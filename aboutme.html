                    Who am I? </h1>

                <h2>
                    I am a 21 year old student at Fontys University Of Applied Science. Currently I am following my
                    advanced phase with the study of Media Design. I have chosen this becasue I would like to be able to
                    make websites and design myself and not to
                    have to rely on others. My interest in computers came from my familly. They are all obsessed with
                    computers and by whatching them enjoy it, I became fond of it. In my life i have studied in 2
                    different countrys where I have had courses for programing. I have studied in Bulgaria and Belgium.
                    Last year my wish to continue studing programing became even stronger. I had to make my own little
                    game with the coding language Python, more specificly pyGames. It was super motivating seeing my
                    code come to life. I want to continue making new things and seeing them appear infront of me. I also
                    had to create a website for set project wich I did not do as well as I would have done it now. I did
                    not have
                    the programming experience yet. Hope
                    you got some information of who I am and what I am.
