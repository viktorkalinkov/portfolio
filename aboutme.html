                    Who am I? </h1>

                <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">
                    I am a 21 year old student at Fontys University Of Applied Science. Currently I am following my
                    advanced phase with the study of Media Design. I have chosen this becasue I would like to be able to
                    make websites and design myself and not to
                    have to rely on others. My interest in computers came from my familly. They are all obsessed with
                    computers and by whatching them enjoy it, I became fond of it. In my life i have studied in 2
                    different countrys where I have had courses for programing. I have studied in Bulgaria and Belgium.
                    Last year my wish to continue studing programing became even stronger. I had to make my own little
                    game with the coding language Python, more specificly pyGames. It was super motivating seeing my
                    code come to life. I want to continue making new things and seeing them appear infront of me. I also
                    had to create a website for set project wich I did not do as well as I would have done it now. I did
                    not have
                    the programming experience yet. Hope
                    you got some information of who I am and what I am.

                    During my second semester in Media Design I have learned alot of useful stuff. When I look at my
                    assigments and project I relise that I have indeed
                    improved in many of my previously lacking sections of my knowledge. I have learned to take better
                    pictures and not just press the button of the camera and hope for the best.
                    My photoshop skills have improved as well. Instead of watching tutorials all I needed is some
                    motivation that was provided by my teacher Jan Salge. Most important for me was
                    to improve my skills with the organisation of my files when starting to create a website. I have
                    picked it up thanks to my Front End Develepor teacher Amer Jaganjac. Working on
                    my programing side was also greatly improved because of the teaching and the obsticals that were
                    shown to us durring this semeste.
